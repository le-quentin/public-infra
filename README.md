# bonnet.software public infrastructure

My public infrastructure, hosted in the cloud (VPS).

Deployed with Ansible.

# Services

Currently runs only my freelancer commercial website, but will run more stuff in the future.

# TODO

- [x] SFTP to fill websites docker volumes
- [ ] try Cockpit for base web-ui admin
- [ ] If Hostinger automatic backups aren't satisfying, docker volumes backups with rclone
